Java History
===============

1) Jan-23rd in 1996
2) Object-oriented, Platform independent, Secure.....
3) Open Source Software
4) JAVA SE6[Dec,11,2006]
5) JAVA SE8[Mar,18,2014]
6) Java is Dynamic programming language
7) Because java allows memory allocation for primitive data types at
   runtime
8) No, java doesn't have any pointer
9) Pointer variables are able to refer a block of memory by storing 
   its address locations.
   Reference variables are able to refer a block of memory by storing object
   reference values
10) Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritence, Polymorphism
11) Code reusability - we can write one method and use multiple times
12) If we declare same variable with different values and same method with different
    implementatiuon in both the super classes and if we access that common variable and
    method at sub class then which super class variable and method will be accessed is big
    confusion
13) Garbage Collector
14) If we declare any operator with more than one functionality then it is called as
    Operator Overloading
15) UNICODE
16) Internationalization is a service in Java, it enables Java applications to take input 
    data in a particulr local language and to provide output data in the same local language
17) Because, Java allows its
    applications to compile on one operating system and to execute on another operating
    system.
18) If we design any java application on the basis of client-server arch then that java
    application is called as Distributed application.
19) All class names , abstract class names, interface names and enum names must be started
    with upper case letter and the sub sequent symbols must also be upper case letters.
20) No, because in java package statement must be first statement!
